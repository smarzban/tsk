# Changelog

One `## vX.Y.Z` section per release, newest first, with `## Unreleased` on top. Inside a
section the subsections are, in this order and only when non-empty: `### Breaking`,
`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`. Every user-visible change lands here in the PR
that makes it, written for a user, not a contributor: omit demo alignment, CI wiring,
review history, and other maintainer-only work. On release the version's section becomes
the GitHub release notes verbatim.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Herdr setup on Windows accepts the supported `0.9.0-preview.*` host builds instead of rejecting them as older than 0.9.0.

## v0.11.4

### Changed

- The Windows PowerShell installer now offers the same Herdr and agent-skill setup prompts and closing guidance as macOS/Linux, while custom and unattended installs remain non-executing.
- Windows `tsk update` keeps console input available for setup prompts without writing the downloaded installer to a replaceable temporary script.

### Fixed

- Windows installation uses the canonical `www.gettsk.sh/install.ps1` endpoint through a scoped one-liner, reports a successful binary install even if user PATH could not be updated, and gives manual PATH guidance.
- Windows plugin cleanup refuses unexpected files instead of recursively deleting them.

## v0.11.3

### Added

- First-class Windows 10/11 ARM64 and x86-64 support for the CLI and TUI, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tsk` storage, `%APPDATA%\herdr\config.toml` integration with PowerShell launchers, agent setup under `%USERPROFILE%`, native release checks, and locked-executable-safe `tsk update`.
- Windows releases include checksum-covered native ARM64 and x86-64 MSVC ZIPs and a complete-download PowerShell 5.1/7 installer that selects the native architecture and adds tsk to user PATH. Pass `-NoPathUpdate` to leave user PATH unchanged. Signing and package-manager submissions remain out of scope.
- `h` and `l` mirror the left and right arrows for closing and opening task details in non-text board and task views; text input keeps both letters.

### Changed

- `walkthrough.json` and `TSK_CONFIG_DIR` are gone: the retired onboarding card is replaced by the seeded tour tasks, and an existing file is simply ignored.
- The `tsk.json.1` last-good backup is replaced by rename, so it is never missing mid-save; stale temp files from the release check and notice delivery are swept with the rest.
- `tsk update` downloads the installer completely before running it, ignores a `TSK_VERSION` set in your shell, refuses to replace a newer copy with an older release, and prints the reason when a Herdr or skill refresh fails.
- The board's release check uses the same HTTPS-only curl as `tsk update` on macOS/Linux, including `TSK_UPDATE_CURL`; Windows uses native HTTPS and the system trust store.
- Agent skill installs replace `SKILL.md` atomically, so an interrupted `tsk setup` leaves the previous skill intact. The embedded skill now detects tsk with the shell-neutral `tsk --version`.
- With neither `HOME` nor `TSK_STATE_DIR` set, tsk refuses to run instead of creating a board in the working directory.
- The plugin manifest declares `min_herdr_version = "0.9.0"`, matching what setup and the launchers already require.

### Fixed

- The Windows installer bounds downloads and ZIP expansion, detects the native machine architecture, preserves expandable user PATH values, and completes locked updates started from PowerShell 7 with stock Windows PowerShell.
- Docs: the palette table no longer lists a `Set done` action (use `ctrl+d`); the step editor's task shortcuts are `ctrl+d` and `ctrl+o` (`ctrl+x` removes the step); `ctrl+r` works from any non-done status; a trashed task is found with `tsk list --deleted`, not a task address.

## v0.10.1

### Changed

- `tsk update` prints the version it replaces and the one it installs, re-registers an already set-up Herdr plugin without asking, and updates outdated installed agent skills (one `[Y/n]` ask on a terminal, unattended otherwise). It never installs a skill for an agent that had none; with nothing installed it offers the first-install ask.
- `tsk setup herdr` leaves a plugin command you bound to another key alone instead of adding the default chord beside it.

## v0.10.0

### Breaking

- Store format 5: one undo entry can cover a marked set. Rolling back refuses the file; restore `tsk.json.v4`.

### Added

- Multi-select: `Shift+M`, then `space`, `Shift+↑`/`Shift+↓`, or a click marks tasks; status, archive, and delete act on the set. One `ctrl+u` undoes a marked done or delete.
- `/` searches every board tab by title, notes, steps, thread, and task number (project names on the Projects overview). `Enter` pins the filter for normal keys; `Esc` clears it.

### Changed

- `!p name`, `tsk add -p name`, and JSON plan projects refuse unknown or ambiguous names (`unknown-project`) instead of creating a stray project. A new project needs an existing absolute path (`/…` or `~/…`).
- `ctrl+q` quits from every non-editor surface, including task pages and the wide project preview. `Esc` closes layers and wide splits, then quits at the full-board root on any tab. Unsaved drafts still block quitting.
- Agent skill 1.3.0 (`unknown-project` refusal, search and multi-select); rerun `tsk setup` to update installed copies.

## v0.9.0

### Breaking

- Store format 4: existing `ready` tasks move to the new `open` inbox on first save. Rolling back refuses the file; restore `tsk.json.v3`.
- `ctrl+n` now sets ready (it no longer opens Notes) and `ctrl+o` sets open (it no longer reopens to ready).

### Added

- `open` status for captured, untriaged tasks: an expandable `inbox` group under ON DECK, `ctrl+n` picks a task for ready, `ctrl+o` sends it back.
- `tsk status T<n> open`, `tsk list --open`, `tsk list --ready`.
- Projects tab at 110+ columns: the cursored project previews beside the index, `→` makes it a live board, `←` and `Esc` walk back.
- Projects index counts ON DECK and DONE next to NEEDS YOU and IN MOTION.
- `tsk list T<n>` prints the whole task: notes, steps, and thread, in human and JSON form.
- `tsk help <command>` as an alias for `--help`, and `tsk --version` / `-V`.

### Changed

- `tsk --help` is the CLI reference: commands grouped with a Statuses block, and one 80-column skeleton per command (usage, options, examples, refusals, exit codes). Long-form detail lives in the CLI guide.
- Refusals print as `code: message` on stderr for every task command; `archive` and `unarchive` gain stable codes.
- The agent skill (`tsk guide`, `tsk setup <agent>`) is slimmed to rules of engagement, board language, the exit contract, and workflows, reads JSON by default, and gains a `Refine a task` section. Skill 1.2.0; rerun `tsk setup` to update installed copies.
- Task page and expanded quick-add share one Tab ring: Title, Notes, steps, + step, Thread, Scope, back to Title; `Shift+Tab` reverses it.
- Task-page footer shows the thread before the project.
- Inbox heading paints in normal text with no blank row under it.
- `ctrl+s` starts open tasks as well as ready ones.
- Board help (`?`) is a searchable shortcut reference: type to filter by key or action, `Esc` clears then closes.
- Human `tsk list` output wraps to the terminal width, supported from 50 columns.
- The starter tour mentions the projects preview and `tsk help`; the upgrade notice covers this release's features.
- The upgrade notice (`What's new in tsk`) arrives in `review` under NEEDS YOU; the last starter guide seeds as `open` so a fresh board shows both ON DECK groups.
- The Homebrew caveat also points at `tsk setup agents`.

### Fixed

- `tsk setup agents --yes --force` rewrites every detected agent skill even when the version already matches.
- `tsk setup herdr` no longer prints the plugin root on success and reports a previous registration whose root is gone before re-registering.
- The selected task-page footer control is no longer dim inside its highlight.
- Expanded quick-add in a project preview keeps its draft title in the column header and styles the active notes line as an editor.

## v0.8.2

### Breaking

- Task store format 3, migrated automatically on first open. Rolling back to 0.7.x afterwards refuses the file; restore the `tsk.json.v2` backup written beside it if you need to.

### Added

- Starter tour on first board open: four desk tasks (`N1` to `N4`) that teach the tabs, sections, status keys, the task page, and the CLI, each cleared for good with `ctrl+d`, `ctrl+f`, or `ctrl+x`. Agents never see them: `tsk list` hides `N` rows.
- What's new on your desk: after an upgrade, one `N` row can summarise the release with a link to the changelog. This release carries none, so a 0.7.x upgrader sees only the tour.
- `tsk update` upgrades installer-managed copies in place; Homebrew copies print `brew update && brew upgrade tsk`. The board nudges once a day when a newer release is out (`TSK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` disables).
- `tsk setup` detects the coding agents on your machine and offers to install the tsk skill for each; `tsk setup agents --yes` does it unattended. The curl installer asks the same question once when Herdr is on PATH.
- Added support for OMP with `tsk setup omp`, thanks @bnivanov.
- Outside Git, the current directory is available as a project: `2` opens its board, quick-add files there once it is open. The desk stays the default for capture and the CLI.

### Changed

- The agent skill (`tsk guide`, `tsk setup <agent>`) is rewritten around a quick-reference table and rules of engagement: agents hand work back with `review` and leave `done` to you. Skill version 1.1.0; rerun `tsk setup` to update installed copies.
- Sections hold their order while you work: NEEDS YOU, IN MOTION, DONE and the drawer's ARCHIVED group keep the most recent status change on top, and ON DECK lists its backlog oldest first, `N` rows leading. Editing a task or ticking a step no longer jumps it to the top.

### Fixed

- On a wide board, clicking a task opens its details beside the board and keeps board focus; a double-click during column reflow opens the task you clicked, not a newly exposed control.
- `prefix+t` opens or focuses one board per Herdr workspace, across tabs, and returns to the tab you pressed it from.
- `tsk setup herdr` on a Herdr older than 0.9 says so (`herdr 0.6.8 found; tsk needs 0.9.0 or newer`) and stops before touching the config, instead of failing on `herdr config check` with a usage dump.
- Setup errors that quote Herdr's output keep their line breaks instead of printing a literal `\u{000a}`.

## v0.7.0

### Added

- `tsk guide` prints the agent workflow, and `tsk setup <claude|pi|cursor|grok|codex|opencode|--skill-dir>` installs it as a skill. `tsk --help` ends with a pointer for agents.
- The installer adds `~/.local/bin` to PATH for Bash and Zsh.

### Fixed

- At 110 columns or wider, `Tab` on the quick-add line opened a draft page that was never painted.
- A reopen request replaced by another of the same size in the same instant could be delivered as the first one.

## v0.6.0

### Added

- Native macOS and Linux binaries, a checksum-verifying install script, and a Homebrew formula.
- `tsk setup herdr` registers the installed binary with Herdr and adds `prefix+t` (board) and `prefix+a` (capture).
- CLI: `tsk status`, `tsk edit`, and `tsk steps rename|remove`.
- **NEEDS YOU** section: blocked and review tasks at the top of the board.
- Projects index with search, per-project status counts, and persistent desk · project · projects navigation.
- Quick capture (`tsk capture`) opens the task editor in a Herdr popup; the expanded quick-add takes threads and steps.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- Wide layout: at 110 columns or wider the board and task page form a four-stage slider driven by `←` / `→`.
- Archive for tasks (`ctrl+f`) and projects (from the `p` picker), with a collapsible archived group in the done drawer and read-only focus for archived projects. CLI: `tsk archive`, `tsk unarchive`, `tsk project archive|unarchive`, `tsk list --archived`.
- Trash: deleted tasks move to `trash.jsonl` once undo can no longer reach them and purge after 30 days. `tsk list --deleted` and `tsk trash restore T<n>`.

### Changed

- State files are private on Unix: `~/.tsk` is `0700` and its files `0600`; symlinked state roots are refused.
- Store format 2: a `projects` map; a v1 store migrates on load and keeps a `tsk.json.v1` backup.
- Undo history is capped at 50 entries.
- License is MIT.

## v0.4.0

- Markdown in notes (view and peek): bold, emphasis, code, fenced blocks, headings, lists, in mono modifiers only.
- Mouse text selection: drag to highlight, release to copy via OSC 52.
- Board and task-page scrollbars with click and drag; the current section header pins under the tabs.
- Modal overlays for help, palette, and project picker share one centered card.

## v0.3.0

- Threads: an optional normalized label per task, set with `--thread` on add or in plan JSON, filtered with `list --thread`.

## v0.2.0

- Steps: an ordered checklist on the task page, with `steps <task> add|toggle` on the CLI. Step progress never changes task status.

## v0.1.0

- Queue board for capture and human status (`ready`, `started`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`) inside Herdr, with peek, task page, project scope, done drawer, and undo.
